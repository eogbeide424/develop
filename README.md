## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://eogbeide424.github.io/develop/)

On this particular project the aim was to refactor the existing code.
I started by trying to make the code more accessible by adding  semantic``html(https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp).  
## Code Snippet
<figure id="search-engine-optimization" class="search-engine-optimization">
            <img src="./assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" class="float-left" 
            alt="seo notebook on table" />
            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <!-- added figcaption for accessibility -->
            <figcaption>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

## Troubles I faced
Some of the issues I faced was getting into the habbit of committing and pushing every step I took to refactor the code. It may show in my git hub repository multiple actions on one commit, also I found out that if my computer goes to sleep I have to save and reopen the project to connect back to the remote repository.

I also added alt attributes to the images and icons to make more accessible.
## alt code snippets 
<h3>Lead Generation</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/lead-generation.png" 
            alt="icon of gear going into a funnel money coming out"/>
            <p>
                Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly to your website.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="icons">
            <h3>Brand Awareness</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/brand-awareness.png" 
            alt="icon of lightbulb signaling awarness on human body"/>
            <p>
                Users find your business through paid and organic searches, increasing the search ranking and visibility for your business.
            </p>
        </div>
        
  And for CSS purposes and Scouts Rule I also consolidated some classes to clean up the css sheet a little bit
